Welcome to the Warren County Astronomical Society Website
This society is organized by volunteers for the enjoyment of astronomy for educational and scientific purposes and is located at Hisey Park, a dark sky area between Lebanon and Waynesville in Warren County, Ohio.

Our members operate the Fred Bay Observatory and share it with the public on behalf of the Warren County Parks Department. We also help operate the Rachel A. Hutzel Observatory at Camp Joy.

You'll find information about our upcoming events and how to become a member on our website. Follow the tabs above for more details.
